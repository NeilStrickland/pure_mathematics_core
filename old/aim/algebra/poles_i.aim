h> ff := Over(Plus(1,x,x^2),
              Times(x^4,(x^2-4)^5));
t> What are the poles and their orders for the following function?
   \[ f(x) = @ff@ \]
   In the table below, enter the poles in the top row, with
   the corresponding orders underneath them in the second row.
   Any boxes that you do not need can be left blank.
