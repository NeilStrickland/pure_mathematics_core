Dates of AIM tests:
Algebra            12/10
Functions          28/10
Differentiation 1   9/11
Integration 1       2/12
Matrices 1         17/12

Trevinder Thandi (aca03tst) got 18 + 5 = 23%.  He has a sick note for 
a broken wrist (note dated 12/11; cast came off 19/12).  This could
have affected the diff1 test (deadline 9/11, not accessed) and the 
int1 test (9.70) and the matrices1 test (17/12, not accessed).  The
maximum extra credit would be 4% giving 27%.

Kayleigh Seal (pma03kls) got 82 + 9 = 91%.  She has a sick note for a
broken elbow.

K D Frimpong-Mansoh (aca03kdf) got 36 + 4 = 40%.  He joined the class
late and was not registered for AIM until 21/10.  I told him not to
worry about the functions test, but he did it anyway and got 4.17.He
claims not to have completed diff1 solely because of a
misunderstanding about the deadline.  He got 7/10 for diff2 and asked
for that to count instead of diff1.  It would be reasonable to give
him an imputed 7/10 for AIM raising his total to 43%.
