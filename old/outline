Algebra
 Skills:
  Expansion; arrangement of terms, systematic ordering
  Factoring
  Manipulation of fractions
  Reduction to partial fractions
  Manipulation of powers
 Key facts: 
  None
 Pitfalls:
  (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2
  (a+b)/(c+d) = a/c + b/d
  a - (b - c) = a - b - c

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Inequalities

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sets
 Examples:
  N, Z, R
  Intervals
  Sets of solutions
  R^2, R^3
  Geometric sets
  Sets of solutions to simultaneous equations
  Sets of matrices
  Sets of functions
 Key Concepts:
  Mathematical objects can & should be gathered into sets
  Geometric figures are sets
  Systems of equations (or inequalities) define sets
 Skills:
  Show that one set is a subset of another
  Show that two sets are the same
  Find the intersection or union of two sets

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Functions in general
 Key concepts:
  The notion of a function
  Domain, codomain, range
  The composite of two functions
  The inverse of a function

 Key skills:
  Decide if a definition is valid
  Find the range
  Find the composite
  Find the inverse

 Pitfalls:
  Functions must be globally defined and uniquely defined
  The range of f : [a,b] -> R need not be [f(a),f(b)]
  f^{-1}(x) != 1/f(x)

 Examples:
  Functions between arbitrary sets
  Functions defined by a formula
  Functions defined by cases (or listing values)
  Functions defined by a procedure
  Functions defined by a picture
  Functions defined by the world
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Special functions
 Key concepts:
  Study classes of functions together
  Trigonometric functions have good closure properties

 Polynomials
  Closed under algebraic operations, and under
   differentiation and integration.

 Rational functions
  [Partial fractions here ?]

 Exponential
 Logarithm

 Hyperbolic functions
 Quadratic formulae for inverse hyperbolics

 Trigonometric functions
  Addition formulae
  Trigonometric polynomials reduce to simple form
  Closure under algebraic operations, derivatives and integrals
  Complex exponentials

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Differentiation
 Meaning
 Definition
 Derivatives of powers from first principles
 Derivatives of standard functions
 Product rule
 Quotient rule
 Chain rule

 Parametric differentiation
 Iterated derivatives and power series
 Classes of functions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Integration
 Meaning
 Fundamental theorem of calculus
 Guessing and checking
 Substitution
 Parts
 Polynomials times trig/exp functions
 Trigonometric polynomials
 Improper integrals

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Vectors and Matrices
 Algebra: dot products, matrix products
 Geometric transformations
 Linear systems as matrix equations
 Solution by Gaussian elimination
 Determinants
 Inverses
