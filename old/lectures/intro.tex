\begin{slide}{Arrangements}
\begin{itemize}
 \fromSlide{2}{
  \item Eleven lectures, one per week until 15/12, except 
   10/11 (Reading Week).}
 \fromSlide{3}{
  \item One tutorial per week; you will be assigned to one of eight
   groups. }
 \fromSlide{4}{
  \item Problem surgeries Tuesday 12:10-13:00 and Thursday
   13:10-14:00, Hicks computer room G11.  (Will move after three
   weeks.) }
 \fromSlide{5}{
  \item Four hours private study per week, working through notes and
   doing problems with AiM (computer aided assessment system).}
 \fromSlide{6}{
  \item Routine problems will be handled by AiM; help given in
   tutorials and/or the problem surgery.}
 \fromSlide{7}{
  \item Less routine problems assigned for you to prepare for
   discussion in tutorials.  You are encouraged to work on these with
   your friends.}
 \fromSlide{8}{
  \item \ghost\vspace{-3ex}
   \begin{itemize}
    \fromSlide{8}{
     \item Five of the AiM tests will together count for 10\% of
      your final mark.  }
    \fromSlide{9}{
     \item 60\% for Section~A of the final exam; similar to the AiM
      questions. }
    \fromSlide{10}{
     \item 30\% for Section~B of the final exam; similar to the more
      challenging problems assigned for tutorials.}

\overlays{9}{%
\begin{slide}{Syllabus}
\begin{itemize}
 \fromSlide{2}{
  \item Manipulation of algebraic expressions and inequalities.}
 \fromSlide{3}{
  \item Sets of numbers, vectors and other mathematical objects;
   geometric figures as sets of points; sets of solutions to equations.}
 \fromSlide{4}{
  \item General theory of functions between sets.} 
 \fromSlide{5}{
  \item Special functions, such as $\sin$, $\cos$, $\exp$ and $\log$.}
 \fromSlide{6}{
  \item Special classes of functions, such as polynomials, rational
   functions, periodic functions, bell curves, \ldots}
 \fromSlide{7}{
  \item Differentiation: the meaning of derivatives, and general
   techniques for calculating them.  Derivatives of particular
   special functions, and of special classes of functions.}
 \fromSlide{8}{
  \item Integration: the meaning of integrals, and general
   techniques for calculating them.  Integrals of particular
   special functions, and of special classes of functions.}
 \fromSlide{9}{
  \item Vectors and matrices, emphasising the link with systems of
   linear equations.}

\begin{slide}{Approach}
\begin{itemize}
 \fromSlide{2}{
  \item Many topics may be familiar from A-level; but we will take a
   higher level approach.}
 \fromSlide{3}{
  \item We will stand back from the detailed calculations, look for
   patterns and common features, and understand more deeply why things
   work the way they do.}
 \fromSlide{4}{
  \item We will provide pointers to other areas of mathematics that
   you may study in the next few years.}
 \fromSlide{5}{
  \item All examples are carefully chosen, and most have a story
   behind them.}
 \fromSlide{6}{
  \item Computer systems such as
   \href{file:///C:/Documents\%20and\%20Settings/Neil\%20Strickland/My\%20Documents/Teach/core/lectures/mapleintro.mws}{\BLUE{Maple}}
   can do algebra and calculus.  This makes life easier but provides
   new challenges.
