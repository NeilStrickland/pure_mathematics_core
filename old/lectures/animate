 The following should work, although only on Windows and MacOS, as far as
 I know. You will also have need to have Quicktime installed.
 
 \documentclass{prosper}
 \makeatletter
 \define@key{PDF}{Movie}{\pdf@addtoks{#1}{Movie}}
 \define@key{PDF}{Activation}{\pdf@addtoks{#1}{Activation}}
 
 \newcommand{\moviewithpreview}[3]{% args: width, preview, movie
     \pdfmark[{\includegraphics[width=#1]{#2}}]{%
     pdfmark=/ANN,Subtype=/Movie,Movie=<< /F (#3) >>,%
     Activation=<< /ShowControls true /Mode /Repeat >>}}
 \newcommand{\movie}[3]{% args:width, height, movie
     \pdfmark[{\hbox to #1 {\vbox to #2 { }}}]{%
     pdfmark=/ANN,Subtype=/Movie,Movie=<< /F (#3) /Poster true >>,%
     Activation=<< /ShowControls true /Mode /Repeat >>}}
 \makeatother
 
 \begin{document}
 
 \begin{slide}{GIF}
 \movie{3cm}{3cm}{elephantwalking.gif}
 \moviewithpreview{3cm}{elephantwalking.eps}{elephantwalking.gif}
 \end{slide}
 
 \end{document}

 The question has been addressed several times (a FAQ?) and here is my
 solution :
 
 \documentclass[pdf,slideColor]{prosper}
 \begin{document}
 \begin{slide}{Movie}
 \begin{center}
    \href{run:movie.mpg}{Clic here}
 \end{center}
 \end{slide}
 \end{document}
 
 This is for a mpg movie but it should work for any format, provided
 you tell acroread what to use to run it. You do that in adding a line 
 in your ~/.mailcap file. In my case this is what i do:
 
 video/mpeg;/usr/local/bin/mpeg_play -dither color -quiet %s
 
 When you clic on the link, the application you choose (here,
 mpeg_play) is launched by acroread. Now, if you want the movie to
 appear in the pdf file, there is apparently a pdf tag called "movie"
 (instead of "run" here i believe) but it seems to be supported only on
 mac and windows versions of acroread so far. :-(
 
 Salut,
 
 S.

 Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't checked the parameters format for ps2pdf. The 
 right command line is:
 ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress f.ps f.pdf
 or
 ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/printer f.ps f.pdf
